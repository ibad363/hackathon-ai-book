## Prompt

Integrated RAG Chatbot for AI/Spec-Driven Book

## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification for the Integrated RAG Chatbot.

- **Branch**: `002-rag-chatbot`
- **Specification**: `specs/002-rag-chatbot/spec.md`
- **Checklist**: `specs/002-rag-chatbot/checklists/requirements.md`

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new feature specification and branch.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Created `spec.md` and `requirements.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating the specification was smooth. The initial description was detailed enough to create a comprehensive spec without needing clarification.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
