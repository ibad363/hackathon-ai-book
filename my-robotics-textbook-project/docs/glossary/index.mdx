# Glossary

A list of key terms and acronyms used throughout this textbook.

### A

**Action (ROS 2)**
: A communication pattern for long-running, asynchronous tasks that provides feedback during execution and can be cancelled. Used for tasks like navigation or manipulation.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
: A broad field of computer science focused on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and perception.

### C

**Colcon**
: The standard build tool for ROS 2, used to compile and install packages in a workspace.

### D

**Digital Twin**
: A virtual model of a physical object, system, or process. In robotics, simulators like Gazebo and Isaac Sim are used to create digital twins of robots and their environments.

**Domain Randomization**
: A technique used in simulation to improve sim-to-real transfer. It involves randomly varying simulation parameters like lighting, textures, and object positions during the training of an AI model.

### E

**Embodied AI**
: A field of AI focused on creating intelligent agents that are situated in a physical or virtual body and can interact with their environment.

### G

**Gazebo**
: A powerful, open-source 3D robotics simulator that is widely used in the ROS community for testing and development.

### H

**Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)**
: A simulation technique where real hardware components (like motor controllers) are connected to a virtual simulation, allowing for testing of low-level hardware and firmware.

### I

**Isaac Gym**
: An NVIDIA toolkit for creating high-performance reinforcement learning environments. It leverages the GPU to run thousands of simulations in parallel.

**Isaac ROS**
: A collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages from NVIDIA, optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and the Jetson platform.

**Isaac Sim**
: A photorealistic, physically-accurate robotics simulator from NVIDIA, built on the Omniverse platform.

### J

**Joint**
: In robotics, a component that connects two links and allows for motion between them (e.g., revolute, prismatic).

### L

**Launch File (ROS 2)**
: An executable script (in Python or XML) used to start and configure a collection of ROS 2 nodes.

**Link**
: A rigid body component of a robot that is connected to other links by joints.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
: A type of neural network with billions of parameters, trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like language.

### M

**Machine Learning (ML)**
: A subfield of AI that focuses on building algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions or decisions.

**Message (ROS 2)**
: A data structure used for communication in ROS 2. Topics, services, and actions all use messages to exchange information.

### N

**Node (ROS 2)**
: The fundamental processing unit in a ROS 2 system. A node is a program that performs a specific task.

**NVIDIA Omniverse**
: A real-time 3D collaboration and simulation platform developed by NVIDIA, which serves as the foundation for Isaac Sim.

### P

**Package (ROS 2)**
: The primary unit for organizing software in ROS 2. A package may contain nodes, libraries, configuration files, and launch files.

**Parameter (ROS 2)**
: A configurable setting for a ROS 2 node that can be changed at runtime.

**Publisher (ROS 2)**
: A node that sends data by publishing messages to a topic.

### R

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward.

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**
: A flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior.

### S

**SDF (Simulation Description Format)**
: An XML-based format used by Gazebo and other simulators to describe the properties of robots, objects, and environments.

**Service (ROS 2)**
: A communication pattern for synchronous, one-to-one request/reply interactions.

**Sim-to-Real Transfer**
: The process of transferring knowledge or a policy learned in a simulation to a physical, real-world robot. Bridging the "reality gap" is a major challenge in this area.

**Simulation**
: The use of a computer program to model the behavior of a physical system. In robotics, this is used for testing, development, and training.

**Subscriber (ROS 2)**
: A node that receives data by subscribing to a topic.

### T

**Topic (ROS 2)**
: A named bus for messages. Nodes can publish messages to a topic or subscribe to a topic to receive messages. It is used for asynchronous, one-to-many communication.

### U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**
: An XML-based format used in ROS to describe the physical structure of a robot, including its links, joints, and sensors.

### V

**Vision Transformer (ViT)**
: A type of neural network architecture based on the transformer model, adapted for computer vision tasks. It treats an image as a sequence of patches, similar to how a language model treats a sentence as a sequence of words.

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Model**
: A single, end-to-end neural network that takes visual and language inputs and outputs actions for a robot to execute.

### W

**Workspace (ROS 2)**
: A directory containing one or more ROS 2 packages, along with build and install artifacts.
