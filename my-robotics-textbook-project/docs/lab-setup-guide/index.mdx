# Lab Setup Guide: Preparing Your Development Environment

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough for setting up the software environment required for this course. Following these instructions carefully is crucial for a smooth learning experience.

## 1. Install Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)

The entire robotics ecosystem, especially ROS, is developed and tested primarily on Linux. We strongly recommend a native Ubuntu 22.04 installation.

-   **Recommendation**: Install Ubuntu in a **dual-boot** configuration alongside your existing Windows or macOS, or as the sole operating system on your machine.
-   **Avoid**: Using a Virtual Machine (VM) is not recommended as you will likely encounter significant performance issues and problems with USB device passthrough and GPU acceleration.

**Follow the official Ubuntu tutorial to create a bootable USB and install Ubuntu:**
-   [Install Ubuntu desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop)

## 2. Install ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill

ROS 2 Humble is the designated ROS 2 version for Ubuntu 22.04. These steps follow the official ROS 2 documentation.

### Step 2.1: Set Locale
Ensure your system locale supports UTF-8.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

### Step 2.2: Add ROS 2 APT Repository
Add the ROS 2 repository to your system's package sources.
```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

### Step 2.3: Install ROS 2 Packages
This command installs the full desktop version of ROS 2, including demos, tutorials, and **Gazebo**.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop-full
```

### Step 2.4: Source the Setup File
To use the ROS 2 commands, you need to source the setup file in your terminal. It's best to add this to your `.bashrc` file so it's done automatically in every new terminal.
```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 2.5: Test your Installation
Run a simple talker/listener example. Open two terminals.
In the first terminal, run the talker:
```bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```
In the second terminal, run the listener:
```bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```
You should see the listener printing messages from the talker.

## 3. Install Gazebo and `ros_gz` Bridge

Gazebo should have been installed as part of the `ros-humble-desktop-full` package. Now, install the necessary packages to bridge ROS 2 and Gazebo.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-gz
```

### Test your Gazebo Installation
Launch a simple Gazebo world:
```bash
gazebo /opt/ros/humble/share/gazebo/worlds/pioneer2dx.world
```

## 4. Install NVIDIA Isaac Sim

If you have an NVIDIA RTX GPU (as per the **Recommended Requirements**), you can install Isaac Sim.

### Step 4.1: Install NVIDIA Drivers
Ensure you have the latest proprietary NVIDIA drivers installed. You can do this through Ubuntu's "Software & Updates" application (`Additional Drivers` tab).

### Step 4.2: Install Omniverse Launcher
1.  Go to the [NVIDIA Omniverse website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/).
2.  Download and install the **Omniverse Launcher** for Linux.

### Step 4.3: Install Isaac Sim
1.  Open the Omniverse Launcher.
2.  In the "Exchange" tab, search for "Isaac Sim."
3.  Click on Isaac Sim and select "Install." Choose the latest available version.

## 5. Set Up Your ROS 2 Workspace

A ROS 2 workspace is a directory where you will create and manage your own ROS 2 packages.

### Step 5.1: Create the Workspace
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws
```

### Step 5.2: Clone Course Examples (Optional)
If a repository with course examples is provided, you would clone it into your `src` directory.
```bash
# Example:
# git clone <repository_url> ~/ros2_ws/src/course_examples
```

### Step 5.3: Build the Workspace
`colcon` is the ROS 2 build tool. Run it from the root of your workspace.
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
```

### Step 5.4: Source the Workspace
After building, you need to source the local setup file to make your new packages available.
```bash
echo "source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Your development environment is now ready!
