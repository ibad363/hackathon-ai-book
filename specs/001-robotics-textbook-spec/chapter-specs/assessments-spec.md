# Chapter Specification: Assessments

**Chapter Title**: Assessments
**Parent Spec**: `specs/001-robotics-textbook-spec/spec.md`
**Status**: Draft

## 1. Learning Objectives

Upon completing this chapter, the reader will be able to:
- Understand the assessment structure for the course.
- Know the requirements and expectations for the midterm and final projects.
- Find the resources needed to complete the assessments.

## 2. Content Outline

This chapter will provide details on the assessments for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course.

**1. Midterm Project (Week 7)**
- **Goal**: To apply the concepts from the first half of the course in a small, integrated project.
- **Task**: Create a ROS 2 application that involves a simulated mobile robot performing a simple task in Gazebo. For example, navigating to a specific point in the environment while avoiding obstacles.
- **Requirements**:
    - The robot must be controlled by ROS 2 nodes.
    - The environment must be a custom Gazebo world.
    - The robot must have at least one sensor (e.g., a laser scanner).
- **Deliverables**:
    - A link to a GitHub repository containing the ROS 2 package and Gazebo world.
    - a short video demonstrating the robot completing the task.
    - A brief report explaining the approach.

**2. Final Capstone Project (Weeks 9-13)**
- **Goal**: To design, build, and demonstrate a more complex robotic system, culminating in the "Autonomous Humanoid" project.
- **Task**: The details of the capstone project are described in the "Capstone Project" chapter. This section will provide a high-level overview of the grading and expectations.
- **Grading Criteria**:
    - **Functionality (40%)**: Does the robot successfully complete the required tasks?
    - **Technical Approach (30%)**: The quality of the code, the use of ROS 2 best practices, and the cleverness of the solution.
    - **Presentation (20%)**: The quality of the final presentation and demo.
    - **Report (10%)**: The clarity and completeness of the final report.

## 3. Chapter Requirements

-   The chapter should be clear and concise.
-   The chapter must not have a quiz.
-   The chapter should link to the Capstone Project chapter.
