Constraints: - Must be informative and engaging (approx. 1500-2000 words). - Must avoid overwhelming beginners with excessive detail.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Informed Beginner (Priority: P1)

As a beginner, I want to read a clear and accessible Introduction so that I can grasp the foundational concepts of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics and understand the book's structure before diving into technical modules.

**Why this priority**: Ensures beginners are not overwhelmed and have a solid starting point.

**Independent Test**: A beginner reader can read the Introduction and accurately explain what Physical AI is and what the book will cover.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a beginner reader has completed the Introduction, **When** asked about the definition of Physical AI, **Then** they can provide a concise and accurate explanation.
2. **Given** a beginner reader has completed the Introduction, **When** asked about the main modules of the book, **Then** they can list them correctly.
